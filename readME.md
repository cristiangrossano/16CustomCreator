# Java Program

## Introduction

This Java program was created by me to help people in the creation of custom commands for the **16 Dokkan Bot** made by **K1mpl0s**.

With this program will be created a **.txt** file ready to be used as command in the bot.  
The only available translations are English and Italian, with the necessary help gave by the community more languages could be implemented.  

## Execution

Now we will see haw to run it.  

1. In the folder of the files open a terminal;
2. Write in the terminal `javac creator.java`;
3. Write in the terminal `java creator`.

Note!
If you get errors after the command `javac creator.java` you should install/update the JDK from this [website](<https://download.oracle.com/java/18/latest/jdk-18_windows-x64_bin.msi>).  

## How it actually works?

The user can create the custom command adding inside the **.txt** file lines for:

1. Stages;
2. Dupe farming;
3. Medals Farming;
4. Level of an EZA.

I'm really sorry for possible wrong spelling in the explanations and in the command.
