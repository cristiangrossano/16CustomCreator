# Java Program

## Introduction

This code was created to have a faster and easier creation of custom commands from the 16DokkanBot made by k1mpl0s.  
Will create a .txt file, with the command ready to be loaded in the bot.  
The only available translations are English and Italian, with help maybe should be implemented more languages.  

## Execution

For example I need the english version (`creator`).
Open a terminal in the folder with the file, then write:

```console
javac creator.java
```

to create an executable file of the script, then use:

```console
java creator
```

to execute it, then enjoy.
